In our Node app, the Discord Bot will connect to Discord API using `discord.js` library, using WebSocket connection, and will listen for any commands prompted from the Discord UI. The Bot has defined a set of commands that will run each time a user uses a slash command.

## Steps for setup

1. Be sure you have[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
2. Open a terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Create a new [Discord](https://discord.com/) account if you do not have one.
4. Create a Discord server to test the bot, then find the server/guild ID by turning the developer mode.
5. Navigate to [Discord Developers page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new app, then find the application/client ID.
6. Invite the bot to your server.
7. Sign up to a free [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) account and find your API key.
8. Sign up to a free [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) account and find your API key.
